[Grove - Temperature & Humidity Sensor (High-Accuracy & Mini)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature%26Humidity-Sensor-%28High-Accuracy-%26-Mini%29-p-1921.html)

This is a multifunctional sensor that gives you temperature and relative humidity information at the same time. It utilizes a TH02 sensor that can meet measurement needs of general purposes. It provides reliable readings when environment humidity condition inbetween 0-80% RH, and temperature condition inbetween 0-70Â°C, covering needs in most home and daily applications that don't contain extreme conditions.

Compiled with sccz80 version 21481-8e126c50b2-20230720, and using zsdcc version 4.3.0 [r14210](https://sourceforge.net/p/sdcc/code/14210/log/?path=/trunk/sdcc).

## Installation

The `z88dk-lib` function is used to install for the desired target. e.g.

```bash
cd ..
z88dk-lib +target th02
```

Some further examples of `z88dk-lib` usage.

list help
```bash
z88dk-lib
```

list 3rd party libraries already installed for the zx target
```bash
z88dk-lib +zx
```
remove the `libname1` `libname2` ... libraries from the zx target, -f for no nagging about deleting files.
```bash
z88dk-lib +zx -r -f libname1 libname2 ...
```

## Usage
    1.git clone this repository.
    2.use `z88dk-lib` to import into z88k
	3.open the demo `TH02_demo.c`
	4.use incantation below
	5.profit

### ZSDCC
`zcc +yaz180 -subtype=app -SO3 --max-allocs-per-node400000 -v -m --list --math32 -llib/yaz180/th02 @test.lst -o test -create-app`

### SCCZ80
`zcc +yaz180 -subtype=app -clib=new -O2 --opt-code-speed=all -v -m --list --math32 -llib/yaz180/th02 @test.lst -o test -create-app`

## Preparation

The library can be compiled using the following command --opt-code-speed=inlineints lines in Linux, with the `+target` modified to be relevant to your machine.

```
zcc +yaz180 -clib=new -x -O2 --opt-code-speed=all --math32 @th02.lst -o ../th02
zcc +yaz180 -clib=sdcc_ix -x -SO3 --max-allocs-per-node400000 --math32 @th02.lst -o ../th02
zcc +yaz180 -clib=sdcc_iy -x -SO3 --max-allocs-per-node400000 --math32 @th02.lst -o ../th02
```

The resulting `th02.lib` file should be moved to `~/target/lib/newlib/sccz80` or `~/target/lib/newlib/sdcc_ix` or `~/target/lib/newlib/sdcc_iy` respectively.
