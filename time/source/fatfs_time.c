    Convert a FAT file system time stamp into a Y2K time stamp.

    wFatDate [in]
    The MS-DOS date. The date is a packed value with the following format.
    Bits    Description
    0-4        Day of the month (1–31)
    5-8        Month (1 = January, 2 = February, and so on)
    9-15    Year offset from 1980, subtract 20 to get Y2K year, add 2000 for Gregorian year.

    wFatTime [in]
    The MS-DOS time. The time is a packed value with the following format.
    Bits    Description
    0-4        Second divided by 2
    5-10    Minute (0–59)
    11-15    Hour (0–23 on a 24-hour clock)
